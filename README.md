Our attempt at ManAct4

System Requirements:

R1 (Spec): Implement a system with a set of nodes and a Critical
Section that represents a sensitive system operation. Any node may
request access to the Critical Section at any time. In this exercise,
the Critical Section can be emulated, for example, by a print statement or
writing to a shared database on the network

R2 (Safety): Only one node may enter the Critical Section at any time

R3 (Liveliness): Every node that requests access to the Critical
Section will eventually gain access
